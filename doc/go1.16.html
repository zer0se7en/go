<h2 id="linker">Linker</h2>

<p>
  This release includes additional improvements to the Go linker,
  reducing linker resource usage (both time and memory) and improving
  code robustness/maintainability. These changes form the second half
  of a two-release project to
  <a href="https://golang.org/s/better-linker">modernize the Go
  linker</a>.
</p>

<p>
  The linker changes in 1.16 extend the 1.15 improvements to all
  supported architecture/OS combinations (the 1.15 performance improvements
  were primarily focused on <code>ELF</code>-based OSes and
  <code>amd64</code> architectures).  For a representative set of
  large Go programs, linking is 20-35% faster than 1.15 and requires
  5-15% less memory on average for <code>linux/amd64</code>, with larger
  improvements for other architectures and OSes.

  TODO: update with final numbers later in the release.
